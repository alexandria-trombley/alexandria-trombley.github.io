<h1>Alexandria Trombley</h1>
<p> I am a student at Tufts University's school of Engineering. I am very interested in how humans interact with the world around them. I have explored this interest in a number of ways, including attending a workshop on Musculoskeletal Modeling and Simulation in Regensburg, Germany, and by joining the AutismSees, LLC team as their Operating Director and as a co-founder. I am also passionate about education, and have explored this passion by working at Live and Learn Early Learning Center, and teaching STEM topics in Boston-area elementary schools through the Tufts Center for Engineering Outreach and Education. Please look through the following documents to find out more about my work and interests! </p>
