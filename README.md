Identify what aspects of the project have been correctly implemented and what have not.

  This project required a resume with specific information, a short bio and an index to links with both of these items. 
  These aspects of the project have been implemented with no errors, according to the W3C validators. Furthermore,
  I created a contact sheet so that anyone who views my page can reach out to me. Also, I made links on each page to 
  all of the other pages so they can be accessed easily. Another requirement of the assignment was a stylesheet with 
  at least 5 rules. my stylesheet has 8 rules pertaining to different blocks, inherent items such as the body
  and different headers, and even a horizontal line used throughout the assignment to visually separate items on the page.
  I do not believe any of the requirements of this project were implemented incorrectly. However, I am looking forward
  to learning more about styling, because this kind of formatting is boring!
  
Identify anyone who helped you with the assignment.
  
  Ming helped me make sure my github repo was working correctly. Otherwise, I just used the HTML cheat sheet from AddedBytes
  provided on the course homepage.
    
Identify how many hours you spent on this project.

  Between 22 and 25. Slow and steady at least completes the project!
