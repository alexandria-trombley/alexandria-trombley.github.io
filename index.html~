		<h1>Alexandria Trombley</h1>
		<p> I am a student at Tufts University's school of Engineering. 		I am very interested in how humans interact with the world 			around them. I have explored this interest in a number of ways, 		including attending a workshop on Musculoskeletal Modeling and 			Simulation in Regensburg, Germany, and by joining the 			AutismSees, LLC team as their Operating Director and as a 
		co-founder. I am also passionate about education, and have 			explored this passion by working at Live and Learn Early 			Learning Center, and teaching STEM topics in Boston-area 			elementary schools through the Tufts Center for Engineering 			Outreach and Education. Please look through the following 			documents to find out more about my work and interests! </p>
